# SafeLinks Skipper

A chrome extension which skips the the intrusive, bloating, spyware "Safe Links" feature that Microsoft offers.

## What it does

**HTML Link Replacement**

Inside the web Outlook client, any hyperlinks you hover over will be replaced with the de-obfuscated URL, taking you directly to the website instead.

**Request Redirecting**

Any `*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com` links you do click on will be redirected before they leave your browser, bringing you directly to the website instead. This means that all safe links regardless of origin (desktop email client, messaging services, other websites, etc) are skipped.
